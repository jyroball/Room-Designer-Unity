# Room-Designer-Unity

The Room Design Viewer will be built using Unity, leveraging its XR Interaction Toolkit for VR support and 3D environment rendering. The software architecture is organized into four major components. First, the VR Environment Layer will manage the creation and rendering of the virtual room, including lighting, navigation, and room scaling. Unity's scene management and physics system will allow users to move through the space naturally and interact with virtual objects. Second, the Furniture & Object System will manage all design elements that can be placed in the room. Objects will be loaded as 3D assets with metadata for dimensions and interaction properties, and will support placement, rotation, and scaling using VR controllers. Third, the User Interface Layer will handle interaction menus, selection wheels, and helper prompts inside the VR environment, allowing users to add, modify, or remove objects intuitively.
